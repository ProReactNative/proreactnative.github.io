### Set up buddybuild.com with continuous integration

Go to buddybuild.com and link your GitHub/Bitbucket repo.

You can set it to build on every push.

If you do this, you can collaborate with a distributed team very easily!

The native developers can push their native code to Buddybuild and Buddybuild will then send you an updated build of the native code. You can then write your Javascript against that native code.

So, it's a bit clunkier than if you had a Mac, yes, but it's pretty damn seamless when you consider than Apple doesn't want you to be doing this in the first place.

Rock on, Linux users.
