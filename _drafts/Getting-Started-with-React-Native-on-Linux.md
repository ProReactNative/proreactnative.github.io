## Proof of Understanding 1

So you're tempted to give React Native a shot.

Either you're an Android veteran or you're an Android newbie.

I'm going to speak to the newbies on this post, bear with me pros.

## Proof of Understanding 2

Linux is the best thing since sliced bread, but the docs on the React Native site are a bit skimpy.

## Simple Solution

### Installing everything

#### Install NodeJS

The first thing you need to do is to install NodeJS, a popular Javascript implementation.

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install -y build-essential
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_4.x | sudo -E bash -
$ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

#### Install NPM

Now that you have NodeJS, you'll need NPM, the standard package manager for NodeJS.

**is this already installed?** 
check using a virtual machine

#### Install watchman

watchman is a tool developed by Facebook for watching the filesystem. For best results, you'll want to install it.

* `git clone https://github.com/facebook/watchman.git`
* `cd watchman`
* `git checkout v4.1.0  # the latest stable release`
* `./autogen.sh`
* `./configure`
* `make`
* `sudo make install`
